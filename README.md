# free_energy_diagrams

This module is designed to produce free energy diagrams given a set of thermodynamic energy levels and kinetic barriers. It was heavily based off a script written by Giacomo Marchioro called PyEnergyDiagrams at their GitHub: giacomomarchioro.

I developed this module during my masters in chemistry at the University of Otago, New Zealand. 

An example script to produce a figure is given at /examples/example_script.py. The saved output of this script is given in .pdf form (converted from .eps) and can be seen below.
